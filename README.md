# User-Manager-Application
This is a fullstack application made by me using boilerpoint code from BootStrap.com. This application was made with SpringBoot and Angualar.

This application manages users in a website. Adding, editing, and editing users can all be done withing the website. 

How to run.
Create a psql database with the name usermanager2021. 
    (Note: you can use sql just change the port and configuration on usermanager/src/main/resources/ application.properties).
Configure database properties on usermanager/src/main/resources/ application.properties.
Run the usermanager folder on a java ide. It has Spring dependencies to make post request.
Run usermanagerapp on another ide such as vscode.
This application requires angular installed
run ng serve.

Check port localhost:4200 for website.

or you can run localhost:8080 and create, edit, and delete users using something like postman. Check ApiData.txt for predefined post methods.
